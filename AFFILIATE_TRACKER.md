### ⚠️ Wired but Broken / Placeholder — Action Required

| Program | Sites | Issue | Fix Needed |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| **FreshBooks** | PH, FH | ⏳ Application pending approval — placeholder ID `1234567` in place. Clicks tracked but earning nothing until approved. | Send real publisher ID once approved → update `go/[slug]/route.ts` on both PH and FH (one-liner swap) |
| **Semrush** | CE | Route `/go/semrush` redirects to semrush.com �� no affiliate tracking | ⏳ Applied on Impact.com 2026-03-30 — pending. Fake `?ref=` param removed 2026-04-07. Replace with real tracking link once approved. Also consider BeRush direct ($200/sale). |

## 🔬 Research Queue — Programs Still To Investigate

Programs that have been referenced or recommended but not yet verified on any network. Each needs: (1) confirm a program exists, (2) identify the network (CJ / Impact / ShareASale / PartnerStack / Direct), (3) record EPC + commission + cookie, (4) queue for application or skip.

### CJ Network — Categories Not Yet Browsed
Wait for CJ activation blocker to clear, then run the `pageSize=500 + get_page_text` sweep technique used for Business/Legal:

| Category | CJ Category IDs | Why Worth Browsing | Target Sites |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Financial Services** (Banking/Trading, Credit Cards, Credit Reporting, Investment, Mortgage, Personal Loans, Real Estate, Tax Services) | TBD — click to discover | Core to FH, some LT fit. Skip TurboTax (already pending). Looking for H&R Block, TaxSlayer, TaxAct, Betterment, Wealthfront, Ally, credit monitoring. | FH, LT |
| **Computer & Electronics** (Computer HW, Computer SW, Computer Support, Consumer Electronics, Peripherals) | TBD | SaaS and tools for PH, CE. Skip QuickBooks, Norton (already pending). Looking for Acer/Dell/HP consumer lines, ABBYY, Altium. | PH, CE |
| **Online Services** (Blogs, Broadband, Domain Registrations, Email Marketing, ISPs, Search Engine, Web Design, Web Hosting/Servers, Web Tools) | TBD | Hosting + dev tools for all 4 sites. Looking for GoDaddy, Namecheap, Hostinger, WP Engine, Kinsta, Constant Contact. | All 4 |
| **Insurance** (Commercial, Personal) | TBD | Commercial insurance could fit LT. Personal insurance could fit FH. | LT, FH |
| **Marketing** (B2B, Network Marketing) | TBD | Potential overlap with Ubersuggest (already captured). | CE, PH |

### Research Workflow (for next session)

3. **Search Impact.com directory** for the FH/PH targets above (requires browser login)
4. **Search Awin directory** for additional programs (already have publisher ID)
5. **Record findings** back into this tracker under "Programs to Apply For" + "CJ Target Advertisers" sections
6. **Update `cj_network_status.md` memory file** with new data for cross-session persistence

## Action Items (Priority Order)

### 🔴 Urgent — Revenue Leakage

- [ ] **FreshBooks — awaiting approval** — Application submitted, pending. Placeholder `1234567` is live. Once approved: send publisher ID → update both PH + FH `go/[slug]/route.ts` in one shot.
- [ ] **Fix CE SEO tool links** — Semrush, Surfer, Moz, Mangools all use fake `?ref=` params. Apply for real programs and replace with tracked links.
- [ ] **Remove Ahrefs link from CE** — Ahrefs has no public affiliate program. Replace with Semrush as the alternative recommendation.

### 🟠 High Value — Apply Now

### 📝 Notes

- **Ahrefs** does not have a public affiliate program (discontinued). Do not list as an affiliate partner.
- **Amazon** requires 3 qualifying sales within first 180 days to avoid account closure. Ensure all 4 tracking IDs have made at least 3 sales.
- **SiteGround** is a direct program — commissions are tiered: 1 sale=$50, 6–10 sales=$75, 11–20=$100, 21+=$125.
- **Awin** programs: always deep-link to a relevant landing page (e.g., `/demo-signup/`) rather than the homepage for better conversion.
- All `/go/` routes log structured click data via `logAffiliateClick()` captured by Cloudflare Workers runtime logs — use this to track which slugs are getting traffic.
