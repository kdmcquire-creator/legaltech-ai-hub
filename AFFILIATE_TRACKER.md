### ⚠️ Wired but Broken / Placeholder — Action Required

| Program | Sites | Issue | Fix Needed |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| **FreshBooks** | PH, FH | Publisher ID is `1234567` (placeholder) — clicks earn nothing | Log into FreshBooks affiliate portal → copy real publisher ID → update `go/[slug]/route.ts` on both PH and FH |
| **Semrush** | CE | Link uses `?ref=clarityengine` — not a real affiliate link, earns nothing | Apply at semrush.com/lp/affiliate-program/ (requires ~1,500 mo. visitors) → replace with real BeRush link |
| **Surfer SEO** | CE | Link uses `?via=clarityengine` — not a real affiliate link | Apply at surferseo.com/affiliate-program/ → replace with real partner link |
| **Moz** | CE | Link uses `?ref=clarityengine` — not tracked | Check Moz partner program status → update or remove |
| ~~**Mangools**~~ | ✅ Fixed 2026-03-27 | ID `a69b590a66aee08840d5414cd`. Links use `#id` fragment (not `?ref=`). `/go/mangools` + `/go/mangools-kwfinder` wired on CE. |

## Action Items (Priority Order)

### 🔴 Urgent — Revenue Leakage

- [ ] **Fix FreshBooks placeholder ID** — `1234567` earns nothing. Log into FreshBooks affiliate portal, copy real publisher ID, update in PH (`site/src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts`) and FH (`site/src/app/go/[slug]/route.ts`).
- [ ] **Fix CE SEO tool links** — Semrush, Surfer, Moz, Mangools all use fake `?ref=` params. Apply for real programs and replace with tracked links.
- [ ] **Remove Ahrefs link from CE** — Ahrefs has no public affiliate program. Replace with Semrush as the alternative recommendation.

### 🟠 High Value — Apply Now

- [ ] **Apply to Semrush BeRush** — $200/sale. Check if CE traffic qualifies at semrush.com/lp/affiliate-program/en/
- [ ] **Apply to Surfer SEO affiliate** — 25% recurring. surferseo.com/affiliate-program/
- [x] **Mangools** — ✅ Approved. ID `a69b590a66aee08840d5414cd` wired. Banners: KWFinder, SERPChecker, SiteProfiler (250×250 iframes).
- [ ] **Apply to LegalZoom affiliate** (CJ/ShareASale) — LT has 16 reviews and 16 guides that naturally reference LegalZoom

### 🟡 Medium — Expand Coverage

- [ ] **Add ConvertKit/Kit affiliate to PH** — PH audience (productivity/AI tools) = good fit
- [ ] **Join ShareASale** — access to WP Engine, OptinMonster, and many SaaS tools relevant to PH/CE
- [ ] **Check Rocket Lawyer affiliate program** — currently a bare URL on LT
- [ ] **Check Spellbook Legal for partner program** — LT reviews them

### 📝 Notes

- **Ahrefs** does not have a public affiliate program (discontinued). Do not list as an affiliate partner.
- **Amazon** requires 3 qualifying sales within first 180 days to avoid account closure. Ensure all 4 tracking IDs have made at least 3 sales.
- **SiteGround** is a direct program — commissions are tiered: 1 sale=$50, 6–10 sales=$75, 11–20=$100, 21+=$125.
- **Awin** programs: always deep-link to a relevant landing page (e.g., `/demo-signup/`) rather than the homepage for better conversion.
- All `/go/` routes log structured click data via `logAffiliateClick()` captured by Cloudflare Workers runtime logs — use this to track which slugs are getting traffic.
